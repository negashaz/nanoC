# Second Phase: Lexical and Syntax Analysis

## Files in the Directory:

- `lexer.l`: Lexical analyzer specification file written in Flex.
- `lex.yy.c`: Generated C file from Flex based on the lexer specification.

- `source_main.c`: Main source file containing the main function.
- `source_test_bubble.nc`: Sample nanoC source file for testing the lexer.

- `parser.tab.h`: Header file generated by Bison for parser declarations.
- `parser.tab.c`: C file generated by Bison based on the parser specification.
- `parser.exe`: Executable file for the nanoC lexer and parser.

- `Makefile`: Makefile for building and running the lexer and parser.

## How to Run the Makefile:

1. Ensure you have [MinGW](https://mingw-w64.org/doku.php) installed on your system, and the MinGW binaries (gcc.exe, flex.exe, bison.exe) are in your system's PATH.

2. Open the command prompt in the directory containing the files.

3. Run the following command to build and run the lexer and parser:
   ```bash
   make run
